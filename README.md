# Diabetes-Prediction-By-ML

- Goal :- In this project we will predict whether a person has diabetes or not?
  - Have diabetes ------> 1
  - Have not diabetes---> 0
   
# Variables/Column/Attributes Description :-

#### Pregnancies 
 - It is kind of test.
 - Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy. 
 - It poses risks like preeclampsia, preterm labor, and increased chances of type 2 diabetes for both the pregnant person and child.
                  
#### Glucose 
   - A blood glucose test measures the level of glucose (sugar) in your blood
   - The amount of glucose in your bloodstream is called blood sugar or blood glucose. 
   - Your body regulates blood glucose levels with insulin, a hormone that pulls glucose from the bloodstream and into cells to be used for energy.
                                                                                                                                              
#### BloodPressure
   - Blood pressure is the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls.
   - Blood pressure target is usually below 140/90mmHg for people with diabetes or below 150/90mmHg if you are aged 80 years or above.

#### SkinThickness 
   - Skin thickening is frequently observed in patients with diabetes. 
   - Affected areas of skin can appear thickened, waxy, or edematous.
#### Insulin 
   - Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone produced by the pancreas.
   - It is essential for allowing your body to use sugar (glucose) for energy. 
   - If your pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin or your body doesn’t use insulin properly, it leads to high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia), which results in diabetes.
   - Insulin therapy is often an important part of diabetes treatment, as it helps keep blood sugar under control and prevents diabetes complications.

#### BMI 
   - BMI stands for body mass index, which is a measure of your height compared to your weight.
   - BMI is a simple and inexpensive screening method for health risks, such as type 2 diabetes.
   - A high BMI indicates a high percentage of body fat, which can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes.
                                                                                        
#### DiabetesPedigreeFunction 
   - The Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF) is a mathematical formula used to estimate the probability of an individual inheriting diabetes based on their family history.

#### Age 
   - Age of the person

#### Outcome 
    - This column will tell us whether there are dieties or not.
    - Have diabetes ------> 1
    - Have not diabetes---> 0
    
# Working Step :-
  - (1) Importing the Required Libraries
  - (2) loading the diabetes dataset to a pandas DataFrame
  - (3) Perform EDA
  - (4) Data Standardization
  - (5) Split the Train and Test data
  - (6) Training the Model
  - (7) Model Evaluation
  - (8) Making a Diadetes Predictive System
